# Elabs matchers

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/elabs/elabs_matchers.png)](http://travis-ci.org/elabs/elabs_matchers)

Elabs matchers aims to extend existing rspec matchers from e.g Rspec, Rspec-rails and Capybara with a set
of less generic once. This could be things like asserting a table appearing in a certain way or check that
an active record instance has been successfully persisted after an update.

It is important to know that this gem aims to extend rspec / capybara with more matchers. If functionality in either of theses
makes any of elabs matchers' matchers obsolete they will be deprecated and removed from elabs matchers.

Below follows a list of matchers that the gem bundles. To get documentation about each matcher the source code is
your best friend at this point.

## Setup

add elabs_matchers to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "elabs_matchers"
```

### Model matchers:
```ruby
record.should be_valid_with("Blog post").as(:title)
hash.contain_hash({ "baz" => "bar" })
record.should persist(:title, "Blog post")
```

### Model helpers:
```ruby
reload(post)
save_and_reload(post)
```

### Acceptance matchers:
```ruby
page.should have_flash_notice("Success")
page.should have_flash_alert("Error")
page.should have_form_errors_on("Name", "Can't be blank")
page.should have_header("Elabs")
page.should have_image("Logo")
page.should have_fields("Author" => "Adam", "Year" => "2011")
page.should have_table_row("Posts", "Title" => "First", :year => "2012") # Moved to https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara_table
page.should have_attribute("Status", "Pending")
```

### Acceptance helpers:
```ruby
select_year_and_month("2010", "March", :from => "Birth date")
```

### Common helpers:
```ruby
normalize_keys({ "First name" => "Adam" })
fixture_file("file.txt")
```

## Configuration

Matchers can be configured in e.g your spec_helper.rb-file:

```ruby
ElabsMatchers.configure do |config|
  config.header_selector = "//h1"
  config.header_selector_type = :xpath
  config.image_selector = lambda { |src| "img[src='#{src}']" }
end
```

See [elabs_matchers.rb](https://github.com/elabs/elabs_matchers/blob/master/lib/elabs_matchers.rb)


## More
The gem includes YARD documentation which can be read with any browser.
The gem's test suite should also serve as detailed documentation for each matcher and helper.
